# Strategic-Voting
In elections that allow more than one candidates are elected per electoral district, political parties with majority votes may lose as a consequence of uneven distribution of votes among their candidates. Strategic voting is a possible way for the political parties of majority votes to prevent the uneven distribution of votes. This project will contain some simulation on the effectiveness of certain strategic voting strateies.

The project is under construction.
