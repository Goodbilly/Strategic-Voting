# Strategic-Voting
In elections like Hong Kong Legislative Council Elections (HK LegCo Elections), more than one candidates are elected per electoral district. Therefore, political parties with majority votes may lose as a consequence of uneven distribution of votes among their candidates. Despite the failure of ThunderGo scheme in 2016, I personally think that strategic voting is a way to prevent uneven distribution of votes. The project will include codes to simulate how effective strategic voting could be in HK LegCo- like elections.

The rules of the HK LegCo Elections as well as the law in Hong Kong has changed dramatically in recent years. To stay away from politics, I will ignore all political factors in the models.

The project is under construction.
